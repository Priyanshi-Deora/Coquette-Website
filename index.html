            <h2>How to be coquette:</h2>
            <p>♡ Highly coded feminine clothing like dresses and skirts are key pieces to nail this look. Choose items
                that accentuate the female form, while still feeling innocent and classy. Items with bardot or
                sweetheart
                necklines and off the shoulder sleeves are delicate yet tasteful.
                <br>
                ♡ Wearing lace detailed aesthetic tops and adding ribbons, doing embroidery, altering the silhouette are
                ideal for this style.

            <h2>The history of being coquette:
            </h2>
            <p>
                ♡ Originating in the 18th century, particularly during the Rococo period, the coquette aesthetic became
                associated with feminine, cute personalities or clothing.
                <br>
                ♡ Having originated in Italian theatrical traditions, the coquette figure became an emblem of French
                femininity in Ancien Régime comedy where she represented the emerging image of the girly, cute, firty
                type of womem.
                <br>
                ♡ Los Angeles-based stylist Marisa Ledford tells PEOPLE, “The coquette fashion trend is Gen Z's take on
                flirty, soft, hyper-feminine style which references the Victorian Regency era."
